Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.\n\n---\nPART ONE:\n\nYour Shiny Application\n\nWrite a shiny application with associated supporting documentation.\n    The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need\n    to get started using your application.\n\n    Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server\n    Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box\n    Share your server.R and ui.R code on github\n\nThe application must include the following:\n\n    Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)\n\n    Some operation on the ui input in sever.R\n\n    Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations\n\n    You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.\n\n    The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.\n\n---\nThe Shiny application in question is entirely up to you.\n    However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start\n    from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm\n    on one of the R datasets packages.\n\n    Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need\n    a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application.\n    You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.\n---\nPART TWO:\n\nYour Reproducible Pitch Presentation\n\n    OK, you've made your shiny app, now it's time to make your pitch. You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html5 slide deck.\n\n    Here's what you need\n\n    5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter\n    Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs\n    A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box\n    Your presentation must satisfy the following\n\n    It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter\n    It must be 5 pages\n    It must be hosted on github or Rpubs\n    It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document\n    NOTE: Slidify is no longer compatible with with Rpubs. If you choose to use Slidify you must share your presentation using GitHub Pages.\n\n    Notice to publish your slidify presentation to github or Rpubs, there's the publish command. This link outlines how to do it (it's one line).\n\nhttp://slidify.org/publish.html\n\nRstudio presenter has a button to publish directly to Rpubs https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200714023-Displaying-and-Distributing-Presentations. If you are using Rpubs, put in the link to the presentation into the submission box as a http:// link not a https:// link.\n\nYou can also publish using both formats to github manually using gh-pages, though your github branch must have a .nojekyll fle and be on a branch names gh-pages. There's more on gh-pages here https://pages.github.com/ and there is a video lecture outlining how to do this.\n\n\n---\n\n",
